Technically, an American is someone from the Americas - i.e. North or South America. However, it is so commonly referring to people from the USA that we'll just ignore that point for now.\r \r An American is someone who lives in the USA. Not all americans are overweight, ignorant pricks with an addiction to burgers and  . Some of them are actually friendly, intelligent people!\r \r Remember, kids: just because meet or hear one person from a certain place doesn't mean that everyone from there is like it. Oh, and did I mention that the actions of the US government don't ALWAYS speak unanimously for every last citizen of the USA? Just wanted to clear that up.\r \r They   some wierd things, though.. They call football soccer, American football football,   aloominum, jam jelly and so on. But belittling them for differences like that would be a bit petty of me, wouldn't it? I'm not even American, so don't just   this off as 'An American trying to defend themself and their country.'\r \r I myself am Canadian, and although SOME Americans are fat, idiotic, ignorant  , many are the exact opposite. A lot of Americans (probably the majority) are genuine, hardworking people who do the best they can to provide for their family with what they have. Many hate Bush, and are glad   taken his position, hoping that it'll lead to more peaceful and better living. Not all of them wanted to even go into Iraq in the first place, and even though the stereotype for Americans are fat and stupid, many of them don't deserve it, and if you think that 300,000,000 people are   asses, you are extremely close  .  Probablly the most bashed on country in the world.\r Things you should know:\r \r 1. Yes, we are aware the term \"American\" can be used for anyone living in North or South America. The term \"British\" can be used for someone from Scottland, Ireland, or England. What else do you want us to call ourselves, United-Statesians? Besides, I don't see you calling people from Brazil or Argentina or Cuba American anyways. Why should we?\r \r 2. Yes, we are aware our President shows serious signs of mental retardation. All goverments have their problems.\r  \r 3. We're not stupid. We don't go around speaking \"American\", laughing at all other \"American\" speaking countries thinking they stole the idea from us.\r \r 4. We're not   extremists or blind conservatives.\r \r 5. Your country   produces almost as much pollution as ours, and seeing as the US is about 3, ,    (9, ,420 km2; gasp! an American knowing about  ? unheard of!) large and has  , ,000 citizens, we're not doing that bad.\r \r 6. Celsuis- Farheniet, Meters- feet, Pounds- killograms. Gallons-  . We use both you know.\r \r 7. We don't hate all Canadians, Brits,  , and Japaneese people. We don't think all Muslims are terrorists. No matter what Bush says, we most definitely don't eat \" \". We don't all support Iraq. We don't think Pakistan is in Africa.\r \r 8. Just because we can't trace our ancestors in America back for 329 years, it doesn't mean we love our country less.\r \r 9. Patrioism is never a bad thing. Even if you lived in the   country in the world, it's still your country.\r \r 10. No, we don't think everyone in the world celbrates July Fourth with us.\r \r 11. We don't eat McDonald's everyday or   cars.\r \r 12. Not everyone speaks like their from Texas. There are forty-nine other states you know.\r \r 13. We don't think we're better than you.\r \r 14. Lastly, half the people that bash us are allies with us. Our country has relations in more than half the world. Most likely, we're best friends. Speaking of an \"typical american\" is as stupid as speaking of an \"typical european\", even worse I believe, though most of them have at least one language in common compared to europe with its   of utterly different languages.\r \r But nonetheless, regarding my own humble experience, I found most americans   really kind, straight, honest and generous people, and despite these qualities, they can be quite (irritating) modestly too. I believe even behind the \"fuck off, leave me alone\"-attitude, some of them have, you still may find a big,   heart in the right place. They live, struggle and suffer as we all do, well, probably in a more intense way. A lot of them have managed to create incredible beautiful and touching things like art, literature, music and other amazing or insane stuff while they have been living in the worst nightmare you can't nor you like to imagine at all. You won't find this special kind of strength and creativity very often outside america. Especially their music can tell you a lot about them; if you're open minded and dig deeper.\r \r  their culture is quite dominating, from an european point of view, but this is because they're often just freaking good in  , and the \"language\" they speak is one everyone can understand. Since the U.S., as well as Canada, were founded by people who came or   from every   place of this planet, americans are the sum of all these origins.  . So, from a different view, we're all americans. If you want to see one, just look into a mirror. If you hate them, you probably just hate yourself.\r \r Regarding U.S. residents, I hope, wish and pray they get their act together again, that they get over all this   they suffer from and rise like  .

This may or may not be true, because they are generally the same in quality, but the other   original prices on their items are much higher (especially   and  , which sell T-shirts for $38 in a heartbeat).  sells clothes and other items (jewelry, sunglasses, bags, etc.) for both females and males. From personal experience, I notice that a lot of people well above their teen years still shop here, for some reason. Although most styles are meant for younger people, the simpler and more basic things can be stretched to people of at most 8 years older. Lately, it seems that Aeropostale has been taking cues from the other three main teen retailers. They have removed   and butterflies from their clothes and general image, and instead replaced it with a more clean and \"mature\" \"A87\" logo. Their models and advertisements generally use the same people all the time, unlike the other stores (probably more  ). Also, they are always   and doing fun,   things instead of a more romantic and mature theme like A&F and HCO use. This new advertising (as well as the logo) is probably used to attract more of   that go to the other three, rather than thinking of Aero as a monkey-butterfly-glittery-kiddish brand. Their original selling price can also hurt your wallet if you are on a tight budget. Their sales are much better than A&F and HCO, however. Stuff can get extremely cheap, especially near the ends of the seasons. Aero hires people of all shapes and sizes and doesn't hire based on looks, as A&F and HCO are known to do. Seeing as most people were slightly disturbed by the butterflies and monkeys, I'm guessing Aero will make an even bigger name for itself in teen retail in the near future. It's a good place to shop, in my opinion."

An   is an individual who is is not sexually attracted to either men or women. Important classifications to note: Repulsed Asexuals: Asexuals that are opposed to the idea of having sex with any other individual. Some may masturbate to release any  , though some even find masturbation  .  Asexuals: Asexuals that are more open to the idea of having sex and may be willing to have sex for the benefit of a sexual partner. Some   asexuals may even enjoy having sex.  Asexuals: Asexuals who have little or no romantic drive. They usually prefer to be single. Some even never experience crushes. Aromantic asexuals are usually repulsed asexuals. Romantic Asexuals: Asexuals who have a romantic drive and often have a desire to find a significant other. Romantic asexuals can be either flexible or repulsed. Flexible ones are usually willing to date   and asexuals, repulsed ones usually prefer to date other asexuals when possible. Romantic asexuals are split into a few subcategories. Hetero-Romantic Asexuals: Asexuals who are EMOTIONALLY attracted to individuals of the opposite gender. Homo-Romantic Asexuals: Asexuals who are EMOTIONALLY attracted to individuals of the same gender.  Asexuals: Asexuals who are EMOTIONALLY attracted to individuals of the same gender and the opposite gender. Pan-Romantic Asexuals: Asexuals who are EMOTIONALLY attracted to individuals of all genders. The purest definition of  , is literally anti sexual. This means that they neither want or need   with another person to feel fulfilled. However, some asexuals   or even like sexual contact with their romantic partners. However, 95% of the time, it is solely for the benefit of their partners as many dislike sex or find little to no pleasure in the activity. As an asexual myself, I've seen many misconceptions about this term.   is not a \"  category\" . Although I don't speak for all asexuals and this isn't an exhaustive list, I'll hope to give more insights to this term since it's only been recently known to the scientific world. According to  , an asexual is a person who \"does not experience sexual attraction\". That's it. That's all. There are common misconceptions about  : 1. \"Asexuals don't like sex\": Some don't want sex. But some enjoy having sex for the pure pleasure of having sex itself. 2. \"Asexuality is  /a choice\": No, it's an orientation. People who identify as asexuals were born that way. 3. \"You will never be in a relationship\": There are many different types of asexuals in the world. No matter what, love is the main thing in a relationship for any sexual orientation. 4. \"There's something wrong with you\": There's nothing wrong with them. Asexuals are just as capable as anyone to lead and maintain a good, happy, and healthy life. There are two general meanings.\r \r 1. The absence of a sexuality, most notably in humans. Some may just not be sexuallly attracted to others, otehrs may completely lack a sex drive or sexual desires. Common misconceptions are that such people have suffered sexual abuse, are emotionally frigid, are closet homosexuals, masturbate ten times a day, are too ugly to get in a sexual relationship or are impotent. This, more often than not, does not apply.\r \r 2. Without sexual intercourse. For example, cells (be it nerve cells, bacteria or other protozoa such as amoeba) reproduce via   (or dividing) as opposed to  . The result tends to be two cells of exactly the same genetic structure as the 'parent cell', though genetic mutation can occur if the DNA is duplicated incorrectly.\r \r Connected words/phrases:  , sexuality, sexual, mitosis,  , queer (asexuality is considered a queer sexuality. This is not a negatiive connotation, only meaning 'different'). A person who does not experience sexual attraction to either gender, but may still experience romantic and physical attraction and even participate in sexual acts for the physical pleasure, etc.\r  Asexual culture and it's definition still  .

Something you should be looking up on   or a    , not urban dictionary. A mental disorder that is poorly understood by many. Contrary to popular belief, people with   aren't retarded. They just don't learn like most other people do. This, in turn, pisses off the faculty at school, and they make everyone around you aware of of your disorder, and since your non adhd classmates don't understand your disorder either, you'll be labeled as different, guaranteeing that you'll be made fun of multiple times. Despite this, adhd people tend to be more intelligent than those who do well in public schools. They don't pay attention in class because guess what stupid teachers? Your class is useless to them and boring as shit, not because they suck at learning. Most kids with adhd are highly creative. After the hell they endure at school, they usually go on to be successful at life and never look back. Famous examples of these people: Albert Einstein,  ,   (baseball legend), will smith, Michael phelps (  medalist swimmer),   (RIP), Walt Disney, and way too many people to list have adhd and go on to do incredible things. Attention   Hyperactive Disorder: ADHD can be very misinterpreted, just because you have trouble focusing on homework and have a lot of energy doesn't necessarily mean you have ADHD, is one of the most common childhood disorders and can continue through   and adulthood. Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and  . If you're sitting at your phone or your computer and you click on random shit because you don't know what to do or if you're too impatient on a screen and you click on whatever shit pops up first, this is impulsive behavior a symptom of ADHD. I think the most misunderstood shit is that people with ADHD can't be smart. Like if you've ever tested ADHD in a place that doesn't understand shit, they'll ask you how you do in school, if you say you're a fuckin  ,they'll automatically assume you don't have ADHD which is total shit.  is  a very real disorder that is over diagnosed. People with ADHD have difficulty sitting still, being quiet, and focusing   at length. These sensations are difficult to explain unless you have them; it is not that the person does not want to focus, or that they are stupid. When someone with ADHD tries to focus on something, the thought often slips away, or  is replaced by another thought - minutes later they will realize they have lost focus.\r \r When a person who does not have ADHD takes ADHD medication, they get high. When a person with ADHD takes ADHD medication, they feel calm, and can focus on things for the first time in their lives.\r \r  People with behavioral issues unrelated to the disorder ( , seeking attention, etc.) are often  incorrectly diagnosed with ADHD. People who just want the diagnosis so they can get their hands on ADHD drugs will pretend to have ADHD symptoms, as well. This is very frustrating, as it diminishes the integrity of those who actually have ADHD, and require medicine to be able to function like normal people can.\r \r People with ADHD are often above average in intelligence. When they are given medication and can function without a mental handicap keeping them down, their whole lives can change for the better. An absolute   that lets a small sample of people have the ability to actually see this generations version of \"normal\" for the mundane bullshit it is. If it was for people like this, its likely the word would  ,  and advancments in science and art would never happen. Usally a person with ADHD already \"gets\" wtf a teacher is saying 2 minutes into her elementary   lesson, and their brains branch to deeper thoughts that need answering, vice the simple bullshit that is still, and will continue to come of her mouth for the next 5 days.

America is where the individual was born therefore that makes them \"American\" as well as a African because of their roots. It is the   term of how to identify a person of African descent that is born in America. A term wrongly used to give identity to, any black person in America.\r African American was actually meant to give an ETHNIC identity to blacks who are descendants of (Black) African slaves who were brought to the United States. This term excludes Black Jamaicans, Nigerians, Kenyans, Black Dominicans,etc.....\r SOME Whites, and sometimes other non-blacks are afraid to call us black, so in any professional setting they will say African American. Other whites   unfair, because they won't get called  , but really it's the same thing as calling whites from Italy Italian, and Asians from China Chinese.

An excellent indie rock/  from the 1990s,   by Mike   (of Owen). American football and rugby are both physically demanding sports... I've played both...   of play are much different though... Rugby is about pure   and   as opposed to football which is about impact in addition to tackling skill and quick linear movement down field. The speed and impact in American football is the reason for the pads (without them, the amount of   and brain injuries would be horriffic)... With regard to the breaks between plays in football, there's a purpose other than giving the big guys on the lines a break (and by big, I mean 300+ pounds...). American football is a game of set plays and tends to get very complex with all the terminology and the amount of plays you have to memorize (most coaches script anywhere from 150 to 250 possible plays per game). Granted, rugby is more fast paced and the plays are more oriented to the flow of the game which makes it pretty exciting to watch and challenging to play. As far as I'm concerned, they're both great sports with their own challenges. a controlled  American Football originates from the English sport of  . It is played between two teams on a field of 100 yards (120 total including the end zones) with a brown oval shaped object called a Football. A team\u2019s objective is to get it\u2019s offense on the field as often as possible (to score) and keep the opponent\u2019s offense off the field when possible, and limit their performance when they are on. Team\u2019s score by driving the ball down the field by running and passing. The most common form of scoring is the touchdown (six points), followed by field goals (3), and (rarely) safeties (2). Immediately following the scoring of a touchdown the scoring team is given the option of performing a   (worth  ) or the point-after-touchdown (PAT, 1 point). Field goals and PATs are scored by kicking the Football between a tall   located behind the end zone. Professional and   games last full 60-minutes while high school games normally run at 48. It\u2019s important to note that due to timeouts and play huddling Football games normally last between 3 and 4 hours. \r \r Critics (normally foreign) seek to compare the playing style of American Football to Rugby. This is inaccurate, however. They are two different sports. While in Football certain positions require significantly larger stature and others do not,   positions in Rugby require relatively large size. Linebackers, Tight Ends, Full Backs and (larger) Quarterbacks are often suitable for Rugby while positions such as Safeties, Half Backs, and Cornerbacks are normally not.   can also suitable for Rugby play but few are. Unlike Rugby, American Football is a strategic sport and hence more importance is placed upon skill in positions. This, along with size differences, is why players rarely play both defense and offense.\r \r Unlike Rugby, by rule, Football play requires one wears protective gear. While in Rugby very large players tend to tackle other very large players, in Football very large players tend to tackle players inferior in size to them which can result in higher rates of injury. In addition to this, turf is becoming increasingly common as a replacement for grass in Football   again reinforcing the necessity for protective gear. Attire includes a hard helmet with  , numbered jersey for identification, shoulder and chest pads, tight pants with  , knee, and thigh pads, and  . Regardless of protective gear, Football has a higher injury rate than Rugby.\r \r It is played on High School,  , and Professional (namely NFL) levels. Rules are generally the same throughout all levels but differ to varying degrees by league and skill level. American Football\u2019s popularity rages in America overwhelmingly as the most-watched sport, but has failed to catch on in popularity in   (only Canada has a variation). Because of this, however, it remains a trademark of   culture.\r"

Apparently an ideology Urban Dictionary has deemed to be appropriate to   upon, by marketing \" , tshirts and  \". A form of society based around the lack of a   and an emphasis on individual freedom and equality. An ideal form of anarchy would involve a cooperative socialist gift economy, in which goods are freely produced and distributed according to need. Crime would not be the huge problem most people would imagine. Anyone with a   of history knows that crime was never a huge problem until   and then  . A focus on community and civic responsibility would nearly eliminate violent crime (smaller, tightly knit communities have virtually no crime, even today). Property crime would be even a less of a problem, given that no one has more than anyone else and destruction of   would be destruction of one's own property. In case a crime is committed, any and every member of the community is capable of either preventing the crime before hand or apprehending the criminal afterwards, a system which worked for thousands of years before police forces became common during the Industrial Revolution. A common argument against such a system is that \"human nature\" would eventually lead to a return of capitalism and the establishment of government. This is not a part of \"human nature\", however. Human beings have almost no instincts at birth. A tendency towards government and capitalism is a product of societal conditioning, not a natural inclination. There have been examples of similar systems working in the real world, including many in Spain during the Revolutions of the late 1930's. Living standards generally increased in these areas.

As   Hennacy said, \"Oh, judge, your damn laws, the good people don't need them and the bad people don't follow them, so what good are they?\" Like I said before, if   were to happen right now chaos would probably ensue, but this largely due to how fucked up our governments have let the world become.\r \r Government is an unneccessary evil.

Chances are they have no fucking clue as to what they're talking about and will tell you that they want chaos so that they can blow things up and drink. Punch them in the face for me.\r \r Anarchy would be a very bad idea to try right now.     is better left as an ideal for people who do get it. It's not something worth arguing about over the internet, because anarchy is not going to happen on a large enough scale to matter in anyone's lifetime who is alive today, and if there was anarchy, there probably wouldn't be an internet for very long ;)."

A female Canadian-born singer and songwriter. Generally speaking, she can write songs that make sense and she can sing at some point. She used to dress and act like an angry   but she changed her style since her third album released. She is both loved and hated by people; some do because of her music and other do because of her persona. She also  , and likes to   such as \"fuck\" and \"damn\". The only thing that many people criticize her is her personality. One minute she was slamming Britney Spears and   that she'd never dress like a music  , selling her body instead of her music, the next minute she's become another Britney Spears, or as she thinks, \"a punk version of Britney Spears and a more mature\" of herself. She then sings songs like \"Hot\" and \"Girlfriend\" and wears revealing clothes. She often claims that she is not a   but in fact she is. Basically, her songs are just pop songs with some rock beats. Since her third album, her style changed to more pop, but she thinks it's girly punk. She now tries to act gothic, and have launched a fashion line of clothes and perfumes(one called \"Forbidden Rose\"). However, despite that many think she's fake and arrogant(she pretended having baby  ), there are still many, most are teenagers, love and support her. She is commercially successful. The self-proclaimed   for a  , quite accurate considering they are both untalented musicians who concentrate more on image and try their best to look \"rebelious\" \"badass\" and \"punk rock\" and was marketed and chosen by   to make money off of kids trying to be \"rebelious\" \"badass\" and \"punk rock\".

I'll admit that although she might be a nice person I'm not a fan of her personallity as she contradictis herself a lot by saying in one interview \"I can play guitar\" and in another \"I can't play guitar  \". same thing with skating. I do however like her music. but most people think she sucks because of her personallity and the things she says. but what they need to do is judge not by personallity but by music. if they think the music sucks then yes hate away but   on a band or singer because of personallity. that's just stupid. download something of hers. see for yourself. but I figured that someone in here needed to put down something at least a little bit good. people spend   trying to diss her when she put HERSELF into a     which she can be criticized."

The   range from very immature (  stuff), through teenage level, to mature (violence, content, thick plot).  The classification of 'hentai' is given to animes of a   sexual nature.\r \r Although over 95% of anime has nothing perverted about it, most   idiots think anime is always a form of pronography. A style of Japanese animation that has become increasingly popular in   culture of many Western societies in recent years. It has a number of genres from all ages and has created a large fan base as well as many people that are opposed to it. You can find many stores selling anime   in American stores as well as many   conventions. It sems to   everyone here seems   on telling us it is not porn; which I find quite suspiscious. I've   anyone one to just asume it was porn. A lot of defintions on here for the word 'anime' have been hopelessly ill-informed. I hope to give a more accurate defintion that doesn't make me sound like an idiot. Anime is a form of animation orginating in Japan. Common elements in characters include large, shiny eyes, often spiky or unusually colored hair, long legs, etc. There are always exceptions to these rules, such as in   movies, which have more realistic proportions and hair. Often in anime, one episode will continue into the next, instead of each episode being a  . There are several different types, like  , for boys, which typically feature a male protagonist and lots of fighting and action,  , for girls, with female protagonists and the main focus being romance or comedy. There is also  , for young women, which I imagine are like soap operas(Never watched any), and  , for teenagers and young men, which are often horror or thriller animes, and are usually considered too scary for children. There is also  / , which is gay/lesbian romance without sex, and yaoi/yuri, which is with sex. Many people say that anime is for 12-year-old dorks, but I myself have watched anime that would scar a 12-year-old for life. They also say anime is porn. There is a category of anime called hentai that is pornographic in nature, but the vast majority is not. Some anime is incredibly good, some is atrocious. And the stereotypes aren't necessarily true for all."

  "short_description": "Atheist\nThere are two in-use definitions of the word &apos;atheist&apos;:1.) A person who lacks belief in a god or gods.  People who use this definition categorize [atheists] as either negative (or [implicit] or weak) atheists or positive (or explicit or strong) atheists.  Negative atheists, while they don&apos;t believe in a god, do not positively [assert] that no gods exist.  Positive atheists, however, do.2.) A person who believes that no god or gods exist.Those who consider themselves atheists (who are usually positive atheists) tend to define &apos;atheist&apos; using the former definition, and those who believe in a god or gods tend to define &apos;atheist&apos; using the latter.  In both cases, this seems to be a demagogic practice intended to classify either as many or as few people as atheists as possible.  Negative atheists are usually referred to as [agnostics].While neither definition of atheism entails any personality traits of atheists or of those who do believe in a god or gods (sometimes referred to as &apos;theists&apos;), both atheists and theists tend to believe that certain traits apply to all atheists/theists.  Common myths about atheists include: all atheists are arrogant, immoral, rebellious, and/or [intolerant]; all atheists really believe in ([the Christian]) God and are simply in denial; all atheists are depressed and believe [life is meaningless].  Common myths about theists include: all theists are naive and/or intolerant; all theists don&apos;t really believe in their god(s) and just pretend to because they&apos;re afraid that if people realised that no god exists, there will be complete chaos; all theists are weak and look to their god(s) for comfort.  It hardly needs to be said that while these myths apply to a select few individuals in each group, the claim that they apply to every atheist or every [theist] is false.Negative atheists justify their lack of belief in god(s) by pointing out that no evidence exists for the existence of god(s), and justify their lack of disbelief by pointing out that no evidence exists for the nonexistence thereof.  Positive atheists often assert that while no evidence for god(s) exists, it should be [by default] assumed that they do not, until evidence is found.  Some also try to use logic to prove that God does not exist, but this is often attached by theists and weak atheists as being mere [wordplay].  Some theists and weak atheists also assert that logic is superficial and meaningless (which is an easily refutable claim), and that [only one&apos;s] inner feelings can lead them to truth.  Some positive atheists (and deists), however, are led to their stance through their feelings.  Some feel that because the world is filled with evil and [malice], and all-loving, [benevolent] god cannot exist.  Those who are led to their stance through this feeling, however, cannot justify their disbelief in a [malevolent] god in the same way.  Some reject the idea of the Christian God because the Bible states that non-Christians are [condemned] to Hell, and reject the idea as being too disturbing.  While the same argument can also be made against the gods of various other religions, including Islam and [Zoroastrianism], it cannot be made against every god (in Judaism, for example, Hell does not exist).",
